        <h1>Football Association Database System</h1>
        <p>The Football Association Database project is designed to model the complex structure of the football world, including clubs, players, leagues, countries, sponsors, and coaches. It tracks essential attributes such as club details, player careers and transfers, league membership, international representation, sponsorship contracts, and coaching history. With its interconnected relationships, the system provides a clear and organized way to store and manage all major football-related data.</p>
